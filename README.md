## Inspiration

iTradeNetwork's Anomaly Detection Challenge!

## What it does

The iTradeNetwork challenge is to develop a system to detect anomalies within their provided dataset of perishable good supply chain invoices. The dataset is almost 500,000 entries, so our solution leverages unsupervised ML to tackle the issue! The challenge does not provide any examples of anomalous data, so we were free to create our own metric. To solve this problem, our system assigns all data samples an anomaly score, allowing us to provide the end user with a stream of potential anomalies, prioritized by likelihood to be anomalous.

## How we built it

After extensive data cleaning,  we developed and trained an autoencoder neural network architecture to embed the data samples. From there, we can algorithmically detect anomalies that rule-sets are likely to miss.
On the front end, we provide the service to the end-user through an easy-to-use web application.

## Challenges we ran into

At the start of the hackathon, our team composed of four group members. However, as time went on, the team size fell to two. With the same goal in mind, we worked with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms that neither of us have ever written. Asides from that, we were working with quite dirty data and utilizing web frameworks that we have minimal experience in.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are extremely happy about the algorithms we wrote to clean and analyze the data! We fought through the struggles of losing teammates and learning new packages/frameworks and were still able to get very close to our end goal.
